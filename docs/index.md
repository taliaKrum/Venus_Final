## Venus Fly Trap
Creative Embedded Systems Final Project 

## The Assignment
The goal is to synthesize different topics that we have covered in class throughout the semester and produce a final project.

## My Project
For this assignment, I took inspiration from venus fly traps. I wanted to create an interactive and kinetic sculpture that acted as the plant would if something touched one of its sensors. In other words, I wanted to extend the touch GPIOs so that if a user touched the sculpture, the "mouth" would open and close. Before starting this project I knew I wanted to learn from the way I worked on past modules take a different approach. I felt like I always dove into the code first and was rushing to finish the physical structure, which usually left the final product sloppier than I expected. Therefore, this time I took more time to make prototypes, research different ways to imitate the venus fly trap's movement, and finally, use the laser cutter and 3D printers available in the design center. I used the laser cutter to cut the lid of the flower pot with openings for the wires 

- creative decisions, inspiration, why i did what i did, research, focus on structure over code
