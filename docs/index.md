## Venus Fly Trap
Creative Embedded Systems Final Project 

## The Assignment
The goal is to synthesize different topics that we have covered in class throughout the semester and produce a final project.

## My Project
For this assignment, I took inspiration from venus fly traps. I wanted to create an interactive and kinetic sculpture that acted as the plant would if something touched one of its sensors. In other words, I wanted to extend the touch GPIOs so that if a user touched the sculpture, the "mouth" would open and close. Before starting this project I knew I wanted to learn from the way that I worked on past modules, and take a different approach. I felt like I always dove into the code first and was rushing to finish the physical structure, which usually left the final product sloppier than I expected. Therefore, this time I took more time to make prototypes, research different ways to imitate the venus fly trap's movement, and finally, use the laser cutter and 3D printers available in the design center. I used the laser cutter to cut the lid of the enclosure with openings for the touch GPIO and servo motor wires. I also cut the venus fly trap lobes. After looking at many videos and options for altering servo motor motion (i.e. eye-lid motion, linear actuators, jaw motion etc), I found files that could mimick wing flapping, which I could easily use for the opening and closing of my plant sculpture - https://learn.adafruit.com/animatronic-cosplay-wings/3d-printing. I had some difficulty connecting the plant lobes to the motors/motor enclosures because the acrylic ended up being a bit heavy. In the end it worked out but if I had more time I would probably use a lighter material or laser cut a smaller shape. Additionally, initially I wanted to use the SPIFFS file system to serve the html, css and js files for the website and have the sculpture communicate over WiFi instead of a serial connection, however the URL wouldn't load. I settled for a serial connection, but if I had more time I would continue trying to work with a server. Finally, I used a flower pot for my enclosure because at the end of the day, I wanted this sculpture to look like a plant :).
