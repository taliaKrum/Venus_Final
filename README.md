# Venus_Final

Creative Embedded Systems Module 5 - Final Project 

Project Specs: The final project is a chance for you to synthesize the topics we have covered so far in class (and the topics we will soon cover).

Project Hardware:
* ESP32 TTGO T-display 
* Power source (laptop)
* Micro Servo (x2) 
* Breadboard 
* Nylon conductive tape 
* Flower pot 

My Project: 

High Level Description - 
* I wanted to build a venus fly trap sculpture that would imitate the movements and behavior of the actual plant. Similarly to a real venus fly trap, if a user touches the inside of the "mouth", the plant will close. I also created a website that mirrors the sculpture- whenever the physical plant closes, an animation is triggered on the website.

Hardware Setup - 
* I used a laser cutter to cut out the venus fly trap shapes and lid of the flower pot

* After all the pieces were ready, I placed the ESP32 and breadboard inside the flower pot, strung the wires through the holes in the top and used hot glue to assemble the plant.
